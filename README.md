1. All submitted code must compile under JDK 8. This includes unused code, so don‚Äôt submit extra files that don‚Äôt compile. Any compile errors will result in a 0.

2. Do not include any package declarations in your classes.

3. Do not change any existing class headers, constructors, instance/global variables, or method signatures. For example, do not add throws to the method headers since they are not necessary.

4. Do not add additional public methods.

5. Do not use anything that would trivialize the assignment. (e.g. don‚Äôt import/use java.util.ArrayList for an ArrayList assignment. Ask if you are unsure.)

6. Always be very conscious of efficiency. Even if your method is to be O(n), traversing the structure multiple times is considered inefficient unless that is absolutely required (and that case is extremely rare).

7. You must submit your source code, the .java files, not the compiled .class files.

8. Only the last submission will be graded. Make sure your last submission has all required files. Resubmitting will void all previous submissions.

9. After you submit your files, redownload them and run them to make sure they are what you intended to submit. You are responsible if you submit the wrong files.

Heap

You are to code a Heap, specifically a MinHeap, that is backed by an array of contiguous elements. Here is a tree and array representation of the same Heap:

A MinHeap is a type of binary tree with two main properties.

‚Ä¢ Shape Property: The tree must be complete. All levels of the tree must be full except the bottom-most level. If the bottom-most level is not full, it must be filled from left to right.

‚Ä¢ Order Property: Each node‚Äôs data is smaller than the data in its two children. There is no explicit relationship between sibling nodes.

These properties guarantee that the smallest element in the heap will be at the root of the heap.

You should implement two constructors for this heap. One initializes the heap to a capacity specified as a constant in MinHeap.java. The other constructor should implement the BuildHeap algorithm that was taught in lecture, which is an algorithm that creates a heap in O(n) time. Simply adding the elements one by one will not receive credit since it would be O(nlog(n)) in the worst case; see the javadocs for this constructor for more specifications.

Unlike your BST homework, you are not required to use recursion in this assignment. Use whatever you find most intuitive ‚Äì recursion, iteration, or both. However, regardless of the technique you use, make sure to meet efficiency requirements as discussed in lecture.

Grading

Here is the grading breakdown for the assignment. There are various deductions not listed that are incurred when breaking the rules listed in this PDF and in other various circumstances.

Methods:

constructor / buildHeap 20pts

add 20pts

remove 20pts

getMin 5pts

isEmpty 5pts

clear 5pts

Other:

Checkstyle 10pts

Efficiency 15pts

Total: 100pts

JUnits

If you need help on running JUnits, there is a guide, available on Canvas under Files, to help you run JUnits on the command line or in IntelliJ.

Style and Formatting

Javadocs

Vulgar/Obscene Language

Any submission that contains profanity, vulgar, or obscene language will receive an automatic zero on the assignment. This policy applies not only to comments/javadocs, but also things like variable names. Exceptions

When throwing exceptions, you must include a message by passing in a String as a parameter. The message must be useful and tell the user what went wrong. ‚ÄúError‚Äù, ‚ÄúBAD THING HAPPENED‚Äù, and ‚Äúfail‚Äù are not good messages. The name of the exception itself is not a good message. For example:

Bad: throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException(‚Äò‚ÄòIndex is out of bounds.‚Äô‚Äô);

Good: throw new IllegalArgumentException(‚Äò‚ÄòCannot insert null data into data structure.‚Äô‚Äô);

Generics

If available, use the generic type of the class; do not use the raw type of the class. For example, use new

LinkedList&lt;Integer&gt;() instead of new LinkedList(). Using the raw type of the class will result in a penalty.

Forbidden Statements

‚Ä¢ package

‚Ä¢ System.arraycopy()

‚Ä¢ clone()

‚Ä¢ assert()

‚Ä¢ Arrays class ‚Ä¢ Array class

‚Ä¢ Thread class

‚Ä¢ Collections class

‚Ä¢ Collection.toArray()

‚Ä¢ Reflection APIs

‚Ä¢ Inner or nested classes

‚Ä¢ Lambda Expressions

‚Ä¢ Method References (using the :: operator to obtain a reference to a method)

If you‚Äôre not sure on whether you can use something, and it‚Äôs not mentioned here or anywhere else in the homework files, just ask.

Debug print statements are fine, but nothing should be printed when we run your code. We expect clean runs ‚Äì printing to the console when we‚Äôre grading will result in a penalty. If you submit these, we will take off points.

Provided

The following file(s) have been provided to you. There are several, but we‚Äôve noted the ones to edit.

1. MinHeap.java

This is the class in which you will implement the MinHeap. Feel free to add private helper methods but do not add any new public methods, inner/nested classes, instance variables, or static variables.

2. MinHeapStudentTest.java

This is the test class that contains a set of tests covering the basic operations on the MinHeap class. It is not intended to be exhaustive and does not guarantee any type of grade. Write your own tests to ensure you cover all edge cases.

Deliverables

You must submit all of the following file(s). Make sure all file(s) listed below are in each submission, as only the last submission will be graded. Make sure the filename(s) matches the filename(s) below, and that only the following file(s) are present. The only exception is that Canvas will automatically append a -n depending on the submission number to the file name(s). This is expected and will be handled by the TAs when grading as long as the file name(s) before this add-on matches what is shown below. If you resubmit, be sure only one copy of each file is present in the submission. If there are multiple files, do not zip up the files before submitting; submit them all as separate files.

Once submitted, double check that it has uploaded properly on Canvas. To do this, download your uploaded file(s) to a new folder, copy over the support file(s), recompile, and run. It is your sole responsibility to re-test your submission and discover editing oddities, upload issues, etc.
